it https://mk-8-dx-mmr.vercel.app/api?id=

just add your id from your profile in https://www.mk8dx-lounge.com/

then add it to Fossabot, Nightbot, StreamElements, whatever bot you using.

note: it will only show your MMR


Examples (using Fossabot variables for this)

```
Aqua MMR: $(customapi https://mk-8-dx-mmr.vercel.app/api?id=50831)
```
it show "Aqua MMR: 504"

or 
```
Gecko has $(customapi https://mk-8-dx-mmr.vercel.app/api?id=10776) MMR 
```

"Gecko has 10776 MMR"
